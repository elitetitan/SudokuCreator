# SudokuCreator
This is a java based project on the famous game Sudoku, in which we can get solution(s) for any Sudoku riddle.

I have made a simple GUI(based on Swing) for giving initial input to the sudoku grid.
You may enter the numbers in the respective cell(s) and then press enter to finalise them. The cell will turn green.
After that click on solve to get the solution.
The solution(s) is/are created using the backtracking technique. We can get multiple solutions too.
The main functions are solver and colSolver, rest functions check the condition imposed in sudoku game.
